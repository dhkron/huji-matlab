TAD.m - Function; Draws heatmap for the specified chr.
	Usage: TAD(chrNumber)
	Returns:

LoadGenomeToHists.m - Function; Loads histograms
	Usage: hists = LoadGenomeToHists(20,40000,5,4)

MotivComp.m - Function; Trys finding motifes.

ShowBounds.m - Script; Loads TAD boundery file, and plots it as vertical lines.

ParseGM.m - Script; Analyizes the GMM paramaters derived from an Hi-C measure, using TAD function.

1/1/2015
* First, configure the chr in TAD.m
* Now run it
* Set boundery file and run ShowBounds.m
* Should match somehow
* Afterwards, use Genome.m on the chr
* Now, find statistics for bounery histograms?

28/1/2015
* MotivHist.m now creates the histogram for given blockset
* Changed several scripts to work as functions

4/2/2015
* Updates
- GenomeComp is also script
- Completed the proceeding method
* CTCF is CCCTC
* Some code changes

6/2/2015
* Changed CMAP actg to acgt
* Some performance tests
* Created function GenomeToWordVec
* Changed GenomeHist accordingly
* Improved loading of chr's
* Computed normalized histogram for each block instead of keeping the block itself
* Implemented load algorithm:
	1. Load all rows
	2. convert to numbers [nt2ind or use cmap]
	3. reshape to long
	4. build N-grams [sub2ind or with simple loop]
	5. reshape to 40k blocks
	6. convert each block to it's histogram
	7. BAD BLOCKS WILL HAVE BAD HISTOGRAMS
* Now use LoadGenomeToHists(20,40000,5,4)
* Histograms are normalized to 1. That means that empty blocks are silently discarded

TODO
* Looking at offsets before and after bounds is interesting.
- If boundsend+1,2,3 is still looking like bounds, what does it mean?- Also, it seems like boundsend+30 is random again. Check it.
* Likelyhood of blocks: use allhists to find logliklyhood of each block
- Simple, multiply block histogram by language model of allhists
- After, do the same for language model of start/end
* Loglikelyhood histogram of all blocks,bounderies,random set
- Hope that the histograms are very different!

Should reconsider this points after talking with Tommy:
* For each chr, draw the avg boundery histogram ('language model')
* Compare the language models
* Compute language model for all combined
- This requires changing Motiv & GHis

17/4/15
* Updated 'Domains' dir to 'TAD' dir
* General modifications to code
* Generated TAD domains

22/4/15
* Fixed bug in addition of one during normalization
* Change ParseGM to a function, added some features

27/4/15
* Taken TADs and computed probabilistic models inside and outside them.

TODO
* Perhaps use new Hi-C data! Theres more accurate stuff than liberman-aiden IMR90s. They say 15000 million interactions, along with diploid stuff. That's 30 times more interactions than me.
* Perhaps I can show that there are three compartments?
* Also - my implementation of IC was all wrong. See "Hi-Corrector: A fast, scalable and memory-efficient package for normalizing large-scale Hi-C data".
> Algorithm:
	Input: the matrix O
	Output: the bias vector b
	Procedure: repeat the following steps in a limited number of iterations.
		1. Initialize b = vector of 1
		2. Perform the following steps in a limited number of iterations
			1) Compute the additional bias vector t = sum of rows
			2) Oij = Oij/(ti*tj)
			3) bi = bi*ti
		3. Finally, Tij = Oij/(bi*bi)
> If it works properly, should consider precomputing bi.
> Also, perhaps I can remove bad columns/rows beforehand === remove blocks from center. For example, if the row is too low beyond a thershold.
> Generally, can standartize the heatmap format to something formal? worth the effot?
* Can a random folding model, and looping constraints explain the TAD structure?
